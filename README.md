# hello-world 

Most of my professional career after high school revolved around sales, mostly electronic & mobile sales but not limited to that. I have sold cars & also ran my own business in property management & real estate investing. After the economic, banking & housing crash however, my business could not survive & went under. After the job market got better, I went back to mobile sales & found that I wasn't happy. I realized I needed to transition into a new career & now here I am trying to code.
